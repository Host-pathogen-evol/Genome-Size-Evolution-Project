# Genome Evolution in Host-Pathogen systems

This page contains the documentation for python and Ipython modules written for the
host-pathogen model detailed in [Carlos Lugo's site](http://calugo.github.io/blog/2014/10/14/genome-evolution-in-host-pathogen-systems/)

For more datailed informations on the models and how to use the codes in the repository, refer to [the page of the project](http://host-pathogen-evol.github.io/Genome-Size-Evolution-Project).

Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any help.

Cheers!
