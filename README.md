#Genome Length Evolution in Host-Pathogen systems.

This page contains the documentation for python and Ipython modules written for the
host-pathogen model detailed in my [site](http://calugo.github.io/blog/2014/10/14/genome-evolution-in-host-pathogen-systems/)

At the minute is contains a lot of redundant code which is of no use, if you stick to the website's description it will
not work. However Im in the processes of fixing it. 

Do not hesitate in contact me if you need any help.

Cheers!
