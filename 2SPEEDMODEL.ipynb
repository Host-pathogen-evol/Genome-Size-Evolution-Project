      "## Recap.\n",
      "\n",
      "We define a host and a pathogen by a set of attributes. The hosts are basically an array of integers, taken from a pool of size $K_H$, whereas the pathogen are labeled with integers from a pool of size $K_P$. For example, lets assume $K_H=1000$ and $K_P=100$, if we form two sets of size $l_P=3$ and $l_H=5$ for the pathogen and host respectively, then two possible *genomes* could be formed by units labeled by numbers taken from those pools, e.g.:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$g_P=\\{e_{1},e_{2}, e_{2} \\}=\\{20,99,1\\}$$ and $$g_H=\\{t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},t_{4},t_{5} \\}=\\{987,23,456,8,654\\}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "We say that a unit $e_n=i$ in the pathogen *interacts* with a unit $t_m=j$ in the host with certain probability $c$. This defines and adjacency list (and a Matrix for the full set of pathogen units) $A_{i,j}$ given by: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "$$A_{i,j}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
      "1 & \\mbox{with  prob $c$}\\\\\n",
      "0 & \\mbox{with prob  $1-c$}.\\end{array} \\right.$$\n",
      "\n",
      "In this model the list of integers and its length will suffice to describe the Host. For the pathogen we consider more attributes in order to define the host-pathogen interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Pathogen's genetic units attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "####Lenght \n",
      "We are interested in the lenght evolution, hence the first attribute to introduce is the unit's length. Every $e_i$ is accompannied by a real number  $l_i$ which stands for the units length. This number may vary in time as a the consequence of an evolutionary event. Given a set of $N_g$ pathogenic units (a genome $g$) the length $L_g$ is simply given by the sum over every unit present: \n",
      "$$L_G=l_{e_1}+l_{e_2}+\\dots+l_{e_{N_P}} \\equiv \\Sigma _{k=1}^{N_P}l_{e_k} $$\n",
      "\n",
      "####Interaction scores and *Expression*\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside with the adjacency list, every *connection* is weighted according to a given score $s_{ij}$ reflecting the fact that a given pathogen unit can improve or worsen its efficiiency due to the number of connections present or as a consequence of a mutational change. The scores are positive real numbers which evolve as described in the next section. For now we introduce the *expression* of a unit, which, as decribed below, is connected to the pathogen's reproduction rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let $\\{s_{i,j}\\}_{j=0}^{L_{H_P}}$ be the list of scores between unit i and the host H. Then we define the expression of unit $i$, by:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ W_i=\\frac{\\alpha}{L_{H_P}c}\\Sigma_{j=1}^{L_{H_P}}w_{ij}$$ \n",
      "\n",
      "Where $w_{ij}=\\frac{s_{ij}^z}{s_{ij}^z+s_o^z}$ ."
